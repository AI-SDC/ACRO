# AI-SDC Family of Tools

The AI-SDC family of tools is a set of intelligent, privacy-focused helpers designed for researchers working with sensitive information. These tools aim to reduce the stress and complexity of privacy checking by automatically flagging risky data in outputs such as tables or graphs.  

Researchers retain full control over decision-making, while the AI-SDC tools improve efficiency and accuracy, making the process of protecting confidentiality smoother and faster for both researchers and output checkers.

### ACRO
- The underlying engine that performs point-of-analysis disclosure risk assessments.  
- A researcher-facing Python front-end.  
- Files enabling researchers to use the Stata interface (“skin”).  

### ACRO-R
- The R interface (“skin”) for researchers who wish to use ACRO within R.  

### SACRO-VIEWER
- An interactive graphical tool designed for output checkers.  
- Supports decision-making regarding the outputs from a researcher’s ACRO session.  

### SACRO-ML

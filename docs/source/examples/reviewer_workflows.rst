Reviewer Workflows
==================

Advanced workflows for output checkers and reviewers using SACRO-Viewer.

.. note::
   This section covers SACRO-Viewer functionality. For ACRO-specific examples, see :doc:`basic_workflow` and :doc:`cross_tabulation`.

Overview
========

This guide covers advanced reviewer workflows for different types of research environments and review scenarios.

Standard Review Procedures
==========================

Individual Output Review
------------------------

Detailed process for reviewing single outputs:

1. **Initial Assessment**
   
   * Check output type and research context
   * Review automatic disclosure check results
   * Identify any immediate concerns

2. **Detailed Analysis**
   
   * Examine statistical methodology
   * Assess disclosure risk in context
   * Consider research necessity and proportionality

3. **Decision Making**
   
   * Apply institutional guidelines
   * Consider precedent and consistency
   * Document reasoning clearly

4. **Communication**
   
   * Provide constructive feedback
   * Suggest alternatives if rejecting
   * Explain approval conditions if applicable

Batch Review Workflows
======================

High-Volume Processing
----------------------

Strategies for managing large numbers of outputs:

**Triage System**:
1. **Auto-approve**: Low-risk outputs meeting standard criteria
2. **Priority review**: High-risk or time-sensitive items
3. **Standard queue**: Regular review process
4. **Escalation**: Complex cases requiring senior review

**Efficiency Techniques**:
* Use filtering and sorting to group similar outputs
* Develop template responses for common scenarios
* Implement dual-review for high-risk items
* Create approval workflows for routine analyses

Quality Assurance
=================

Review Consistency
------------------

Maintaining consistent standards across reviewers:

**Calibration Exercises**:
* Regular training sessions with example cases
* Inter-reviewer reliability testing
* Discussion of edge cases and precedents
* Updates on policy changes and new guidance

**Documentation Standards**:
* Standardized comment templates
* Clear reasoning requirements
* Consistent risk categorization
* Audit trail maintenance

Specialized Workflows
=====================

Research Domain-Specific Reviews
--------------------------------

**Health Data**:
* Additional privacy considerations
* Clinical relevance assessment
* Regulatory compliance checking
* Patient consent verification

**Financial Data**:
* Market sensitivity evaluation
* Regulatory reporting requirements
* Commercial confidentiality assessment
* Systemic risk considerations

**Administrative Data**:
* Policy implications review
* Public interest considerations
* Freedom of information compliance
* Stakeholder impact assessment

Multi-Stage Review Process
==========================

Complex Approval Workflows
---------------------------

For high-stakes or sensitive research:

**Stage 1: Technical Review**
* Automated disclosure checks
* Statistical methodology assessment
* Data quality evaluation
* Initial risk categorization

**Stage 2: Domain Expert Review**
* Subject matter expertise application
* Research context evaluation
* Methodological appropriateness
* Policy relevance assessment

**Stage 3: Senior Approval**
* Final decision authority
* Institutional risk assessment
* Precedent consideration
* Strategic alignment review

**Stage 4: Documentation and Release**
* Decision documentation
* Approval condition specification
* Release authorization
* Monitoring setup

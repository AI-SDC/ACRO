Integrating ACRO tools with Trusted Research Environments.

.. note::
   This section covers integration across the SACRO family of tools. For ACRO-specific examples, see :doc:`basic_workflow` and :doc:`configuration`.

Overview
========

Trusted Research Environments (TREs) provide secure computing environments for working with sensitive data. The SACRO family of tools integrates seamlessly with TRE infrastructure.

Common TRE Platforms
====================

Airlock Systems
---------------

Integration with airlock-based data egress systems:

**ACRO Integration**:

* Compliance with airlock file format requirements
* Integration with approval workflows

**SACRO-Viewer Integration**:
* Direct connection to airlock review interfaces
* Automated status updates and notifications
* Secure file transfer protocols
* Audit trail integration

**Configuration Example**:
* Output directory mapping to airlock folders
* Automated file naming conventions
* Metadata tagging for review prioritization
* Integration with institutional authentication

Cloud-Based TREs
-----------------

Integration with cloud TRE platforms:

* Priority levels set based on output characteristics

**Stage 3: Review Process**
* Automated pre-screening for obvious approvals/rejections
* Human review for complex cases
* Decision tracking and audit trail generation
* Feedback delivery to researchers

**Stage 4: Output Release**
* Approved outputs automatically processed for release
* File format conversion if required
* Secure transfer to designated locations
* Confirmation and receipt tracking

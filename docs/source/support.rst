==================
What ACRO Supports
==================

This page provides a comprehensive overview of ACRO's capabilities for researchers, developers, and non-technical stakeholders. ACRO supports a wide range of statistical analysis functions with automated disclosure control.

.. note::
   **Drop-in Replacements:** ACRO functions are designed as direct replacements for standard analysis commands. Simply prefix your existing commands with ``acro.`` to enable automatic disclosure checking.

Supported Data Analysis Functions
==================================

Table Creation & Cross-tabulation
----------------------------------

**For Researchers:**
Create frequency tables and cross-tabulations with automatic cell suppression for small counts.

**What ACRO Supports:**

* **crosstab()** - Cross-tabulation of two or more variables with frequency counting
* **pivot_table()** - Spreadsheet-style pivot tables with aggregation functions
* **table()** - Simple frequency tables for categorical data

**Technical Details:**
- ACRO suppresses, and reports the reason why, the value of an aggregation statistic (mean, median, variance, etc.) for any cell is deemed to be sensitive
- The current version of ACRO supports the three most common tests for sensitivity: ensuring the number of contributors is above a frequency threshold, and testing for dominance via N-K rules
- Automatic flagging of negative or missing values for human review

**Example Use Cases:**
- Survey response analysis by demographics
- Clinical trial outcome tables
- Market research cross-tabulations
- Educational assessment reporting

Statistical Modeling
---------------------

**For Researchers:**
Run regression analyses with automated checks on model outputs and residual degrees of freedom.

**What ACRO Supports:**

* **ols()** - Ordinary Least Squares linear regression
* **logit()** - Logistic regression for binary outcomes  
* **probit()** - Probit regression for binary outcomes

**Technical Details:**
- For regressions such as linear, probit, and logit, the tests verify that the number of residual degrees of freedom exceeds a threshold
- Within the ACRO Python package, the functionality of the 'ACRO' class is split into a number of separate classes for maintainability and extensibility. A 'Tables' class contains the code necessary to perform disclosure checks on tabular data, such as crosstab. A separate 'Regression' class contains the code for checking regressions such as logit and probit

**Example Use Cases:**
- Economic modeling and policy analysis
- Medical research and clinical studies
- Social science research
- Business analytics and forecasting

Programming Language Support
============================

Python (Primary)
-----------------

**For Developers:**
The ACRO package is a lightweight Python tool that sits over well-known analysis tools that produce outputs such as tables, plots, and statistical models

**Supported Libraries:**
- **Pandas** - For data manipulation and table creation
- **Statsmodels** - For statistical modeling and regression analysis
- **NumPy** - For numerical computations

**Python Version Support:**
- Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13

R Language
----------

**For R Users:**
Additional programming languages such as this R package are supported by providing front-end packages that interface with the core ACRO Python back-end

**Integration Features:**
- Native R syntax and workflows
- R Markdown and Shiny application support  
- Tidyverse compatibility
- CRAN package availability

**Getting Started in R:**
```r
library("acro")
acro_init(suppress = TRUE)
```

Stata Integration
-----------------

**For Stata Users:**
ACRO is designed to let you use familiar commands in R, Stata and Python

**Features:**
- Drop-in replacement for standard Stata commands
- Familiar Stata syntax and workflows
- Integration with existing Stata scripts

Disclosure Control Features
===========================

Automated Sensitivity Testing
------------------------------

**What ACRO Checks:**

**For Tables:**
- Minimum cell counts (frequency thresholds)
- Dominance rules (N-K rules for concentration)
- Presence of negative or missing values

**For Statistical Models:**
- Residual degrees of freedom thresholds
- Model fit diagnostics
- Parameter significance testing

**For Non-Technical Users:**
ACRO automatically identifies when research outputs might reveal sensitive information about individuals or organizations, applying industry-standard privacy protection rules without requiring manual review of every result.

Output Management
-----------------

**What ACRO Provides:**

* **Suppression Masks** - Clear indication of which results are hidden and why
* **Summary Reports** - Detailed explanation of all disclosure checks performed
* **Audit Trails** - Complete record of all analysis steps and decisions
* **Exception Handling** - Process for requesting release of flagged outputs

**Workflow Integration:**
The finalise function will: Check that each output with "fail" or "review" status has an exception, if not you will be asked to enter one. Write the outputs to a directory. This directory contains everything that the output checkers need to make a decision

- Standard scientific computing libraries (pandas, numpy, statsmodels)
- Minimal computational overhead
- No external network dependencies during analysis

**Security Features:**
- Local processing only (no cloud dependencies)
- Audit logging and tracking
- Configurable disclosure thresholds
- Role-based access controls (through integration with TRE systems)

**Documentation and Support:**
Standard Python coding and naming practices have been used throughout. GitHub continuous integration (CI) runners automatically generate and publish API documentation using the Python docstrings written in numpydoc format

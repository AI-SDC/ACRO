    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "For the purpose of this tutorial we assume some minimal prior experience with using python for data science.  \n",
    "In particular the use of the industry-standard Pandas package for:\n",
    "   -  storing and manipulating datasets\n",
    "   -  creating basic  tables, pivot_tables, and plots (e.g. histograms)\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is a Jupyter notebook split into cells.\n",
    "- Cells may contain code or text/images, and normally they are processed by stepping through them one-by-one.\n",
    "- To run (or render) a cell click the *run* icon (at the top of the page) or *shift-return* on your keyboard.\n",
    "  That will display any output created (for a code cell) and move the focus to the next cell."

    "## A: The basic concepts\n",
    "### 1: A research _session_: \n",
    "by which we mean the activity of running a series of commands (interactively or via a script) that:\n",
    "-  ingest some data,\n",
    "-  manipulate it, and then\n",
    "-  produce (and store) some outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2: Types of commands: \n",
    "Whether interactive, or just running a final script, we can think of the commands that get run in a session as dividing into:\n",
    "- *manipulation* commands that load and transform data into the shape you want\n",
    "- *feedback* commands that report on your data - but are never intended to be exported.\n",
    "  For example, running ```head()``` or ```describe()``` commands to make sure your manipulations have got the data into the format you want.\n",
    "-  *query* commands that produce an output from your data (table/plot/regression model etc.) that you might want to export from the Trusted Research Environment (TRE)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3: Risk Assessment vs decision making: \n",
    "SACRO stands for Semi-Automated Checking of Research Outputs. <br>\n",
    " The prefix 'Semi' is important here - because it in a principles-based system humans should make _decisions_ about output requests. <br>\n",
    "To help with that we provide the SACRO-Viewer, which collates all the relevant information for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key part of that information is the  _Risk Assessment_. \n",
    "- Since it involves calculating metrics and comparing them to thresholds (the TRE's risk appetite) it can be done automatically, at the time an output query runs on the data.\n",
    "- This is what the ACRO tool does when you use it as part of your workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4: What ACRO does\n",
    "The ACRO package aims to support you in producing *Safe Outputs* within minimal changes to your work flow.\n",
    "To do that we provide:\n",
    "- drop-in replacements for the most commonly used *output commands*,\n",
    "  - keeping the same syntax as the originals, and\n",
    "  - supporting as many of the options as we can (features supported will increase over time in response demand).\n",
    "- a set of *session-management* commands to help you manage the set of files you request for output.\n",
    "- **Important to note** that currently acro outputs results (tables, details of regression models etc.) as `.csv` files. <br>\n",
    "  - In other words we separate the processes of _creating_ outputs - which *must* be done *inside* the TRE.<br>\n",
    "    from the process of _formatting_ them for publication - which can be done outside the TRE with your preferred toolchain.\n",
    "  - ACRO handles creation. We are interested in hearing from researchers whether it is important to support them with formatting"

    "There are basically three choices:\n",
    "1. We might decide these low numbers reveal something where the public interest outweighs the disclosure risk.<br>\n",
    "Rather than being a strict rules-based system, acro lets you attach an 'exception request' to an output, to send a message to the output checkers.<br>\n",

    "acro.add_exception('output_0',\"I think you should let me have this because...\")\n",

    "3. We can redact the disclosive cells - and **acro will do this for us**.<br>\n",
    "We simply enable the option to suppress disclosive cells and re-run the query.\n",

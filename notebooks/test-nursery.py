# Load test data
# The dataset used in this notebook is the nursery dataset from OpenML.
# - The dataset can be read directly from OpenML using the code commented in the next cell.
# - In this version, it can be read directly from the local machine
#    if it has been downloaded.
# - The code below reads the data from a folder called "data"
#   which we assume is at the same level as the folder where you are working.
# - The path might need to be changed if the data has been downloaded and stored elsewhere.
# - for example use:
#    path = os.path.join("data", "nursery.arff")
#    if the data is in a sub-folder of your work folder


# commented out version to load from web
# from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml

# Examples of producing tabular output
#  We rely on the industry-standard package **pandas** for tabulating data.
#  In the next few examples we show:
#  - first, how a researcher would normally make a call in pandas,
#    saving the results in a variable that they can view on screen (or save to file?)
#  - then how the call is identical in SACRO, except that:
#    - "pd" is replaced by "acro"
#    - the researcher immediately sees  TRE output checking recommendations.

# Regression examples using ACRO

# 2: Remove some ACRO outputs before finalising
#  This is an example of deleting some of the ACRO outputs.
#  The name of the output  to be removed should be passed to the function remove_output.
#  - Currently, all outputs names contain timestamp;
#    that is the time when the output was created.
#  - The output name can be taken from the outputs listed by the print_outputs function,
#  - or by listing the results and choosing the specific output that needs to be removed

# 4: Add a comment to output
#  This is an example to add a comment to outputs.
#  It can be used to provide a description
#  or to pass additional information to the output checkers.

#  This is an example to add an unsupported outputs (such as images) to the list of outputs

acro.custom_output(
    "XandY.jpeg", "This output is an image showing the relationship between X and Y"
)


# 6 (the big one) Finalise ACRO
#  This is an example of the function _finalise()_
#  which the users must call at the end of each session.
#  - It takes each output and saves it to a CSV file.
#  - It also saves the SDC analysis for each output to a json file or Excel file
#    (depending on the extension of the name of the file provided as an input to the function)

print(
    "\nUsers MUST call finalise to send their outputs to the checkers"
